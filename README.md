## Buttons

- Buttons appear above the current line when a CSS or Tailwind number value is detected.
- ▲▼ - Increment/decrement the targetted number.
- x1 - Cycle between 0.1x, 1x, and 10x step sizes.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The buttons are just a marketing ploy... the shortcuts are where the real magic happens ♡

| Shortcut | Command |
|----------|---------|
| `Ctrl+Up` | Increment number |
| `Ctrl+Down` | Decrement number |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Up` | Increase step size |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Down` | Decrease step size |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Right` | Jump to next value within current line |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Left` | Jump to previous value within current line |

**Note about conflicts:**
You can always reassign the shortcuts to your liking or disable them altogether.
The shortcuts only activate when the extension activates. i.e. you are editing a CSS, SCSS, Less, HTML, JSX, or TSX file and your cursor is positioned on a line that contains a valid CSS or Tailwind number value. This way they minimize conflicts with existing shortcuts..
